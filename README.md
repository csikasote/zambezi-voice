# Zambezi Voice

## Introduction

<div align="justify">
<p>The Zambezi Voice project is an on-going effort by the University of Zambia speech and language research group  to develop/create speech and language data resources that would enable and foster the development of speech-based systems like speech recognition (ASR), machine translation (MT), speech-to-text (STT) translation for low-resourced Zambian languages.</p>
</div>

## Objectives
<div align="justify">
  <p> To build speech and language data resources for under-resourced languages of Zambia that will:.</p>
</div>

  - enable development of speech and language technologies like:
    - Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)
    - Machine Translation (MT)
    - Speech-To-Text Translation (STT)
    - Multilingual Speech & Language Processing Tasks
       
   which presently are currently practivcally unavailable, or useless due to extreme data-scarce setting.
   
  - serve as benchmark for academic and industry tools. We will create training/development/test splits for all task in consideration.
    
## Languages

<div align="justify">
  <p>For our long term goal, we want to create/gather resources for all seventy-two (72) languages spoken in Zambia. In the immediate terms, we are focussing on the seven (7) main languages spoken in Zambia: Bemba, Nyanja, Tonga, Lozi, Kaonde, Lunda and Luvale.</p>
