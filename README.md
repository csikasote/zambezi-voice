# Zambezi Voice

## Introduction

The Zambezi Voice project is an on-going effort by the University of Zambia speech and language research group  to develop/create speech and language data resources that would enable the development of speech-based systems like speech recognition (ASR), machine translation (MT), speech-to-text translation for low-resourced Zambian languages.

## Goal

To build speech and language data resources that would enable development of speech and communication technologies as well as advance research for low-resourced Zambian language.

## Target Languages
For our long term goal, we want to create/gather resources for all seventy-two (72) languages spoken in Zambia. 
In the immediate terms, we are focussing on the seven (7) main languages spoken in Zambia: Bemba, Nyanja, Tonga, Lozi, Kaonde, Lunda and Luvale.
